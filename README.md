# Odin - Admin Dashboard
The 7th [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) of The Odin Project, Javascript path.

See the result [here](https://pinsonjulien.github.io/odin-admin-dashboard/)

## Known issues

- The aside menu doesn't fit the whole screen on some screen sizes, it should be fixed.
- The header should stay on top of the screen when scrolling
- A burger button to show the aside menu would be better for the small screens.
